- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: âœ… **PASSED** - All quality checks completed successfully

### Validation Details:

1. **Content Quality**: 
   - Specification focuses on WHAT users need and WHY, not HOW to implement
   - Uses WordPress as platform assumption only, no specific code implementation details
   - Business value is clear throughout (patient care, physician efficiency, family support)
   - Written in accessible language suitable for clinic stakeholders

2. **Requirement Completeness**:
   - All 39 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous
   - 24 success criteria are measurable with specific metrics (time, percentage, counts)
   - Success criteria are technology-agnostic (e.g., "Parents can find information within 3 clicks" not "React component loads in X ms")
   - 6 prioritized user stories with complete acceptance scenarios
   - 8 edge cases identified covering boundary conditions and error scenarios
   - Comprehensive scope definition with Assumptions, Dependencies, Constraints, and Out of Scope sections

3. **Feature Readiness**:
   - Each functional requirement maps to user stories and acceptance criteria
   - User scenarios progress logically from P1 (critical parent information seeking) to P3 (enhancement features)
   - All user stories are independently testable and deliver standalone value
   - Clear separation between what's in scope (informational website) and out of scope (patient portals, telehealth, etc.)

### Key Strengths:

- **Dual-audience approach**: Clear distinction between family and professional content needs
- **Comprehensive accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance integrated throughout requirements
- **Measurable success**: Specific metrics for performance, readability, and user satisfaction
- **Risk awareness**: 10 identified risks with mitigation strategies
- **Realistic scope**: Clear boundaries on what the website will and won't do

### Notes:

- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers were required as the original specification provided sufficient detail
- WordPress CMS assumption is appropriate and documented in Assumptions section
- Deliverables section provides clear guidance for design and development phases
- Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan` phase
