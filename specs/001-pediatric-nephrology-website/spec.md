## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-16

- Q: How should the website determine which language to display initially? → A: User explicitly selects language on first visit via prominent language switcher, then preference is saved in browser (cookie/localStorage) for future visits
- Q: What happens when content exists in one language but not yet in others? → A: Content can be published in English first, with Sinhala/Tamil translations added later; language switcher shows fallback to English if translation unavailable
- Q: How should fonts be handled for Sinhala and Tamil content? → A: Use web fonts from Google Fonts or similar CDN that support Sinhala/Tamil Unicode with fallback to system fonts if loading fails
- Q: How should search work when users type queries in different languages? → A: Search prioritizes results in user's selected language, with option to expand search to include other languages if needed
- Q: How should article translations be structured and linked? → A: Each translation is a separate content entity with language attribute and links to related translations (e.g., English article ID 123 links to Sinhala article ID 456, Tamil article ID 789)
- Q: What happens when CDN-hosted web fonts for Sinhala/Tamil fail to load or load slowly? → A: Immediately render with system fonts, swap to web fonts when loaded (FOUT - Flash of Unstyled Text with font-display: swap)
- Q: How should outdated or deprecated medical articles be handled across all three languages? → A: Update articles in-place with prominent "Updated [date]" notice and version history; archive truly obsolete articles with redirects to replacement content
- Q: Who maintains the medical abbreviation/synonym mapping for search and how is it kept current? → A: Medical staff maintain glossary
- Q: How should user behavior data (language preference, journey progress, search queries) be stored for privacy compliance? → A: No persistent storage at all; users must re-select language each visit and journey progress is not tracked
- Q: What is the remediation workflow when accessibility issues are discovered post-launch? → A: Critical/high-severity issues fixed within 1 week; medium/low within quarterly maintenance cycles; monthly accessibility audits scheduled to catch issues proactively

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Parent Finding Treatment Information (Priority: P1)

A parent whose child has just been diagnosed with a kidney condition visits the website to understand the diagnosis, available treatments, and what to expect during their child's care journey.

**Why this priority**: This is the primary use case representing the most common visitor scenario. Parents need immediate, accessible information during a stressful time, and this directly impacts patient care and family wellbeing.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by navigating from homepage to a condition explainer page, verifying content readability, and accessing related treatment information. Delivers immediate value by providing critical health information.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a parent visits the homepage for the first time, **When** they look for information about their child's kidney condition, **Then** they can find the "Kidney Conditions" section within 3 clicks
2. **Given** a parent is reading about a kidney condition, **When** they need simpler explanation of medical terms, **Then** content is written at grade 8-9 reading level with clear definitions
3. **Given** a parent has read about a condition, **When** they want to learn about treatment options, **Then** related treatment articles are clearly linked and labeled "For Families"
4. **Given** a parent is viewing treatment information, **When** they need to know what their child will experience, **Then** the procedure page describes the experience from a child's perspective
5. **Given** a parent needs support resources, **When** they finish reading about a condition or treatment, **Then** family support resources are prominently displayed

---

### User Story 2 - Referring Physician Accessing Clinical Guidelines (Priority: P2)

A referring physician needs to quickly access referral protocols, clinical guidelines, and criteria for referring patients to the paediatric nephrology clinic.

**Why this priority**: Physicians are a key referral source and need efficient access to professional resources. This impacts patient flow and inter-professional collaboration but is secondary to direct patient/family needs.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by accessing professional content through dedicated navigation, verifying content contains clinical details and citations, and confirming referral process documentation is available. Delivers value by streamlining physician workflow.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a referring physician visits the website, **When** they need clinical information, **Then** professional content is clearly labeled and distinguishable from family-focused content
2. **Given** a physician is viewing professional articles, **When** they need to verify information credibility, **Then** content includes citations, references, and author credentials
3. **Given** a physician wants to make a referral, **When** they look for the referral process, **Then** referral guidelines and contact information are easily accessible from professional content sections
4. **Given** a physician needs specific clinical protocols, **When** they use the search function with the "For Professionals" filter, **Then** results show only professional-level content

---

### User Story 3 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P3)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

### User Story 3 - Patient Journey Navigation (Priority: P2)

A family whose child will undergo kidney transplantation needs to understand the complete journey from pre-transplant preparation through post-transplant care, accessing information in a logical sequence.

**Why this priority**: Complex medical journeys require structured information delivery. While critical for comprehensive care understanding, it builds upon basic condition/treatment information (P1).

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by following a multi-article journey module (e.g., "Navigating a Kidney Transplant"), verifying sequential navigation works, and confirming each stage provides appropriate information. Delivers value by reducing family anxiety through structured guidance.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a family needs to understand a multi-step treatment journey, **When** they access a journey module, **Then** articles are grouped into a clear sequential series with visible structural indicators (e.g., "Article 2 of 5")
2. ~~**Given** a family is partway through a journey module, **When** they need to find where they left off, **Then** the system shows their progress through the series~~ **REMOVED**: No user progress tracking for privacy compliance; users navigate series manually
3. **Given** a family completes one article in a journey, **When** they finish reading, **Then** a clear "Next in series" link guides them to the following article
4. **Given** a family needs an overview, **When** they view a journey module, **Then** all articles in the series are listed with brief descriptions

---

### User Story 4 - Mobile Parent Seeking Quick Information (Priority: P3)

A parent at work or traveling needs to quickly find specific information about their child's upcoming appointment or medication instructions using their mobile device.

**Why this priority**: Mobile access is essential for modern healthcare information, but after establishing core content and navigation (P1-P2). This ensures the foundation works before optimizing for mobile-specific scenarios.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested entirely on mobile devices by searching for specific information, navigating to relevant pages, and verifying readability and touch-target accessibility. Delivers value by providing anytime, anywhere access.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a parent accesses the site on a mobile device, **When** they view any page, **Then** content is fully readable without horizontal scrolling and touch targets are appropriately sized
2. **Given** a parent on mobile needs to call the clinic, **When** they view the header, **Then** the phone number is prominently displayed and tap-to-call enabled
3. **Given** a parent on mobile uses the search function, **When** they type a query, **Then** autocomplete suggestions are easily tappable and results are mobile-optimized
4. **Given** a parent on mobile views the navigation menu, **When** they open it, **Then** all categories and subcategories are accessible without awkward scrolling or tiny text

---

### User Story 5 - Accessibility for Users with Disabilities (Priority: P3)

A parent with visual impairment or other disability needs to access all website information using assistive technologies like screen readers, keyboard navigation, or high-contrast mode.

**Why this priority**: Legal compliance and inclusivity are critical, but accessibility features can be tested and refined after core functionality is established. WCAG 2.1 AA compliance is non-negotiable but can be validated after basic features work.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested using screen readers (NVDA/JAWS), keyboard-only navigation, and contrast checkers. Delivers value by ensuring equal access to medical information for all families.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user with visual impairment uses a screen reader, **When** they navigate the site, **Then** all content, images, and interactive elements have appropriate ARIA labels and alt text
2. **Given** a user cannot use a mouse, **When** they navigate using keyboard only, **Then** all interactive elements are accessible via tab navigation with visible focus indicators
3. **Given** a user with low vision, **When** they need to increase text size, **Then** they can scale fonts up to 200% without content overlap or layout breaking
4. **Given** a user with color vision deficiency, **When** they enable high-contrast mode, **Then** all text meets WCAG 2.1 AA contrast ratios (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)

---

### User Story 6 - Staff Profile Discovery (Priority: P3)

A family wants to learn about the medical professionals who will care for their child, viewing staff credentials, specializations, and approachable personal information to build trust before appointments.

**Why this priority**: While important for trust-building, staff profiles support the primary content (conditions/treatments). They enhance the experience but aren't critical for the initial information-seeking journey.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by navigating to staff profiles, verifying all required information displays correctly, and confirming photos and bios create an approachable yet professional impression. Delivers value by humanizing the care team.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a family wants to meet their care team, **When** they access the staff section, **Then** they can view profiles with friendly photos, accessible bios, and professional credentials
2. **Given** a family is viewing a staff profile, **When** they read the biography, **Then** it balances personal approachability with professional expertise
3. **Given** a family needs to find a specialist, **When** they browse staff profiles, **Then** specializations and areas of expertise are clearly indicated
4. **Given** a family reads a professional article, **When** the author is a staff member, **Then** the profile is linked for additional credibility

---

### User Story 7 - Multilingual User Accessing Native Language Content (Priority: P2)

A Sinhala or Tamil-speaking parent whose child has been diagnosed with a kidney condition needs to access medical information in their native language to fully understand the diagnosis and treatment options.

**Why this priority**: Language barriers can significantly impact health literacy and patient outcomes. Providing content in users' native languages is essential for the local Sri Lankan audience but builds upon the core content structure (P1).

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by selecting Sinhala or Tamil language, verifying content displays correctly with proper Unicode rendering, navigating through articles, and confirming fallback to English when translations unavailable. Delivers value by making critical health information accessible to non-English speakers.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a Sinhala-speaking parent visits the website for the first time, **When** they select Sinhala from the language picker, **Then** the interface switches to Sinhala and their preference is saved for future visits
2. **Given** a Tamil-speaking parent is reading an article in Tamil, **When** they navigate to related content, **Then** Tamil versions are shown when available, with clear indication if only English version exists
3. **Given** a parent has selected Sinhala as their language, **When** they search for a medical term in Sinhala script, **Then** search returns relevant Sinhala content results with proper Unicode rendering
4. **Given** a parent is viewing content in their selected language, **When** they switch to another language using the language switcher, **Then** the same article appears in the new language if translation exists, or shows the English version with a notification
5. **Given** a parent is reading content with Sinhala or Tamil text, **When** they view the page on any device, **Then** fonts render correctly with proper Unicode support showing all characters clearly

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user searches for a medical term that has multiple meanings (e.g., "stones" could refer to kidney stones or bladder stones)?
- How does the system handle extremely long article titles or staff names that might break layouts, especially with Sinhala/Tamil text which may have different character widths?
- What happens when a patient journey module has more than 10 articles in sequence?
- How are articles handled when they could legitimately be categorized in multiple sections (e.g., a treatment that also discusses a specific condition)?
- What happens if a user with low bandwidth tries to load a page with multiple high-resolution images and web fonts for Sinhala/Tamil?
- How does the search function handle medical abbreviations (e.g., "CKD" vs. "chronic kidney disease") across different languages?
- What happens when a referring physician needs to access the site outside business hours for urgent referral information?
- **Resolved**: Outdated medical articles are updated in-place with prominent "Updated [date]" notice and version history visible to users; truly obsolete content (deprecated treatments, superseded protocols) is archived and replaced with 301 redirects to current replacement articles; all language versions must be synchronized when updates occur
- What happens when a user shares a URL for a specific language version (e.g., /si/conditions/nephrotic-syndrome) but the recipient has a different language preference set?
- How does the system handle mixed-language content (e.g., English medical terms within Sinhala sentences)?
- What happens if Unicode fonts fail to load on older devices or browsers?
- How are translation inconsistencies or errors reported and corrected without breaking live content?

## Risks

1. **Medical Content Accuracy**: Risk that outdated or inaccurate medical information could harm patient care decisions
   - *Mitigation*: Implement regular content review schedule, version control for articles, and clear last-updated dates

2. **Accessibility Compliance Failure**: Risk of not meeting WCAG 2.1 AA standards could result in legal liability and exclude users with disabilities
   - *Mitigation*: Conduct accessibility audits throughout development, use automated testing tools, and engage users with disabilities for testing

3. **Poor Reading Level**: Risk that family content is too complex, alienating primary audience
   - *Mitigation*: Use readability checkers during content creation, test with representative parents, and maintain editorial standards

4. **Search Inadequacy**: Risk that medical search doesn't handle terminology variations, making content undiscoverable
   - *Mitigation*: Build comprehensive synonym list, test search with real user queries, implement robust medical abbreviation handling

5. **Performance Degradation**: Risk that adding 500+ articles causes slow page loads and poor user experience
   - *Mitigation*: Implement caching strategies, optimize images, use content delivery network (CDN), and conduct performance testing at scale

6. **Mobile Usability Issues**: Risk that complex medical information is difficult to consume on small screens
   - *Mitigation*: Prioritize mobile-first design, test on variety of devices, simplify navigation, and use progressive disclosure patterns

7. **Audience Confusion**: Risk that parents accidentally read professional content or physicians miss family-oriented explanations
   - *Mitigation*: Use clear visual distinctions, prominent audience labels, separate navigation paths, and filtered search

8. **Content Management Complexity**: Risk that clinic staff find WordPress theme too complex to update content
   - *Mitigation*: Provide training, create documentation, use intuitive custom fields, and establish content templates

9. **Brand Inconsistency**: Risk that balancing "professional medical" with "family-friendly" results in unclear brand identity
   - *Mitigation*: Develop comprehensive style guide, create design system, conduct user perception testing, and maintain strict design review

10. **Privacy Violations**: Risk of inadvertently displaying patient information in photos, testimonials, or case studies
    - *Mitigation*: Establish clear content guidelines, require releases, use stock photos, anonymize all examples, and conduct privacy audits

11. **Translation Quality Issues**: Risk that poor translations lead to medical misunderstandings or loss of meaning in Sinhala/Tamil content
    - *Mitigation*: Use professional medical translators, implement review process by bilingual medical staff, maintain glossary of medical terms, and collect user feedback on translation quality

12. **Unicode Rendering Failures**: Risk that Sinhala/Tamil characters don't display correctly on some devices or browsers
    - *Mitigation*: Test extensively across devices and browsers, implement robust font fallbacks, use web font CDN with high availability, and provide system font alternatives

13. **Content Synchronization Lag**: Risk that English content updates are not promptly translated, creating information gaps between languages
    - *Mitigation*: Establish translation workflow with defined SLAs, use content versioning to track translation status, display last-updated dates per language, and prioritize critical medical updates

14. **Search Performance with Multiple Languages**: Risk that search functionality degrades when indexing content in three different scripts
    - *Mitigation*: Optimize database indexing for Unicode, implement language-specific search algorithms, use dedicated search service if needed, and conduct performance testing with multilingual data

## Success Metrics Collection Method

- **Analytics Integration**: Google Analytics or similar tool configured to track page views, time on page, bounce rates, and conversion flows, segmented by language
- **User Testing**: Conduct moderated usability sessions with 5-10 parents (including Sinhala and Tamil speakers) and 3-5 referring physicians during development and post-launch
- **Accessibility Audits**: Use automated tools (WAVE, axe DevTools) plus manual screen reader testing and keyboard navigation verification across all languages; conduct monthly audits post-launch to proactively identify issues; categorize issues by severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low) and track remediation timelines
- **Performance Monitoring**: Use Google PageSpeed Insights, WebPageTest, and server monitoring tools to track load times including web font loading for Sinhala/Tamil
- **Search Analytics**: Track search queries, click-through rates on results, and zero-result searches to identify content gaps, segmented by language
- **Reading Level Verification**: Use Flesch-Kincaid readability tools for English content during content creation and periodic audits; use equivalent readability assessment for Sinhala/Tamil
- **Feedback Collection**: Optional feedback forms on articles asking "Was this helpful?" and "What could be improved?" in all three languages
- **Physician Surveys**: Email survey to referring physicians 3 months post-launch asking about usefulness and content quality
- **Content Management Tracking**: Monitor time required to publish/update content including translation workflow and staff satisfaction with CMS workflow
- **Mobile Analytics**: Segment analytics by device type to compare mobile vs. desktop performance and behavior
- **Language Usage Analytics**: Track language selection patterns, language switching behavior, and fallback notification views
- **Translation Quality Monitoring**: Collect user-reported translation issues, track translation completion rates, and monitor time lag between English publication and translation availability
